# Data Structures and Algotithms Study Material
The idea about this repository is save and share my studies about Data Structure and Algorithms.

All theoretical part is being based on Jay Wengrow's book [_"A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms - Second Edition"_](https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Guide-Structures-Algorithms-Second/dp/1680507222/ref=sr_1_1?crid=ACD0HCKZKRG2&keywords=a+common+sense+guide+to+data+structures+and+algorithms&qid=1637177261&qsid=141-3457049-6381441&sprefix=a+common%2Caps%2C221&sr=8-1&sres=1680507222%2C1680502441%2CB093N93PFD%2C1617295485%2CB01D24NAL6%2C1492043451%2C0984782850%2C0262033844%2C1789801214%2C1118771338%2C1449364934%2C195120400X%2C1789537177%2CB07N3SC7W2%2CB09L37B2Z7%2CB084RFJFZ9&srpt=ABIS_BOOK) and I will try to attach code examples linked with learned theory.

I hope you like the content presented and continue to follow the entire study process.
